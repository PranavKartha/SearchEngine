1.  Experiment 1 tests the time it takes to do a top kSort for many different sizes of lists.
	Experiment 2 tests the time it takes to do a top kSort for many different values of K.
	Experiment 3 tests the methods with very large size inputs.  It also implements three different hashcodes
	to see how effective/fast each one is.

3.  My predictions seemed to be accurate:  the tests seem to test what I thought they would. 
 There were some discrepancies thought: Experiment 2 had some numbers that didn’t fit with the overall trend of the data,  
 and I didn’t realize that changing the hashcode would have such a dramatic effect on the time taken.
